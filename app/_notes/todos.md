# TODO:
  - improve car graphics
  - add user controls
  - add scenery
  - decide on camera
  - add shareable url params for tracks
  - allow multiple coasters
  - add camera controls
  - add collision checks during track building
  - bgm & sfx
  - add loop-the-loops
  - add play/pause per coaster
  - consider doing rendering for track rather than per piece
    - this would allow more ambitious curves because the Frenet-Serret frames would be correct like with the coaster train
    - update: I tried it and there are problems
      - The frenet frames are different than the coaster's orientation because the coaster uses lookAt with an up direction of y. As a result, we can get unwanted twists in our curves.
      - The rendering assumes all the track pieces are the same design. It doesn't allow for station pieces, for example.
